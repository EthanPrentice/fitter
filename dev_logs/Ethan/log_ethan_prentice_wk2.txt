Added Welcome workflow to sign user up (bulk of the work)
Added a lot of custom views to support the welcome workflow

Discussed future features w/ team

Attached the UI of the welcome workflow to the model - sign up functionality now working with Firebase

Made minor changes to the model for how we handle callbacks

Added messages to the AuthFragments for any exceptions that arise from Firebase or other means to make errors clear to the user

Teaching other group members a bit about the Android lifecyce, hopefully move on to custom views and resources later on


Total time spent on project: 9hrs
