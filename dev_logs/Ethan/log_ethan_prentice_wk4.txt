For the week of Oct 5th, 2020

Added functionality for cloud to store user avatars as a bitmap blob in firestore
Added a generic FitCardView that is subclasses by a single card view for the user's profile at the moment
Designed user's my profile screen and programmed a large chunk of it (now displays one of the cards)

Refactored how measurements are stored in the user class and in the cloud to match the client-side data-model
(FitMeasure are now stored exactly as-is with dateLogged, units, and number in the cloud.  This makes it locale-aware for conversions)

Added bottom navigation in layouts (currently non-functional)

Added a collapsing toolbar with very basic functionality (just the title right now)
MyProfileFrag makes use of this for when we scroll down so the user display name is always visible.

Added the UserActivity and linked it in on successful authentication from the AuthActivity.
This activity only makes use of the MyProfileFrag at the moment.


Total time spent on project: 7-8hrs
