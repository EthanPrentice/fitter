Tasks
  Met with team to discuss project details and progress
  Met with team again to explain the client data model to the cloud team and align on cloud model
  Discussed project ideas and features with team
  
  Programmed the base class structure of the model with an example for user authentication to use while explaining the model to Simon
  
  Designed and programmed authentication screens for sign-up and login, the model now supports sign-up but calls must be added to the UI to support this which should be minimal effort
  Authentication screens transition and have clean animations
  Authentication screens also use all color reference for clean dark mode
  Activities and fragments confirmed to save instance state in-case of recreations
  Part of doing this also required programming generic ui components that will be used throughout the app:
    Views:
      FitButton.kt
      FitEditText.kt
     Animations:
      ResizeAnimation.kt
  
  Discussed welcome flow and how to handle the creation of users between auth and firestore
  
  
Project time allocation: 13hrs
