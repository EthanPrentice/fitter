For the week of Nov 23rd, 2020

Code cleanup

Wrote all the component and design diagrams for D3
Heavily proofread the D3 document to meet what the spec was asking for.
I also added detailed information for my thought process for all design decisions, as well as architecture decisions.

Presented D3 to Csaba, essentially re-iterating my raw thought process for all design and architecture decisions.

Total time spent on project: 12hrs
