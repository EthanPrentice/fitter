For the week Sept 28th, 2020

Improved welcome workflow

Added MeasuredEditText to display and convert measurements
Changed the model to use Android's Measure framework, subclassing Weights and Heights from FitMeasure which extends Measure
Also created a MeasureConverter singleton for conversions since this is not handled by Android's framework

Designed and programmed the user's "My Profile" screen
Helped Simon w/ welcome flow recovery
Taught Simon some more basics on Android wrt custom views, fragments, and activity lifecycles


Total time spent on project: 7s
